    "Transportation and mobility is a vital issue for all city residents, regardless of socioeconomic status. Transportation planners are faced with the difficult task of designing an fair, equitable system that serves all citizens,m regardless of socioeconomic status. The reality is that not every system is perfect. Gaps in the transit network can develop due to various political and economic factors. These gaps can have a huge impact on property values, crime rate, and economic development in the city. These issues can have far reaching consequences in terms of fostering inequality between neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my project, I investigated the makeup of the Seattle transportation network using the Google Maps Distance Matrix API. This API works very similarly to the directions feature on the Google Maps platform. Users input an origin and destination and receive a travel time estimate for various modes of transportation. In order to assess mobility, I will compare the travel times via driving and via public transit trip times for trips between origins and destinations around the Seattle metropolitian region. Areas in which travel times via public transit are significantly longer will be deemed less accessible. This is a very human-centered approach to assessing mobility because mode choice often begins with an inquiry to Google Maps. People make their choices based on the travel times and convenience of each mode. Using the Google Maps Distance Matrix API will hopefully be directly reflective this choice that people make when choosing their mode of travel."

    "The idea of using the Google Maps Distance Matrix API was inspired by a Data Science for Social Good project at the University of Washington in Summer 2018. The project created a mobility index and also generated predictions of mode choice on a Census tract level within neighborhoods. Further detail on this project is available here (Seattle Mobility Index Project): https://escience.washington.edu/2018-data-science-for-social-good-projects/\n",
    "\n",
    "My project will use a similar approach, but with a reduced scope due to project constraints. With my analysis, I hope to assess effectiveness of this approach and create a high level glimpse into mobility between neighborhoods in Seattle.\n",

    "### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "** 1\\. Can Google Maps Distance Matrix API be used to effectively assess mobility? **\n",
    "\n",
    "I intend to assess the advantages and disadvantages to using this approach and potential bias that may exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2\\. Which neighborhoods in Seattle are underserved by the public transit network?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the results, I will assess which areas may be underserved by public transit in the Seattle region.\n",
    "\n",
    "** 3\\. Which neighborhoods in Seattle suffer from the worst traffic congestion on the morning commute?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using travel times from peak and non-peak hours, I will assess which neighborhoods suffer from the worst traffic congestion on the morning commute.\n"

Public transit options are relatively limited further in North Seattle. However, this area has already has a planned Link expansion opening in 2021 and 2024. This should be vital in better connecting these neighborhoods to the rest of the Seattle metropolitan region.\n",

    "The impact of Link access is readily apparent in South Seattle. Othello and Columbia City were amongst the top neighborhoods in public transit access. However, this is likely due to some bias in the neighborhood selection. These neighborhoods were located at their respective Link train station, which likely underestimates the true public transit travel time for the whole neighborhood. Leaving directly from the train station will result in faster travel times via public transit.\n",

    "Despite geographic constraints, neighborhoods in West Seattle were roughly average in terms of their transit access. However, Admiral was one of the worst performing neighborhoods in terms of transit access, which could identify a need for additional bus lines, etc. to better connect this neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most neighborhoods located downtown scored very favorably in terms of transit access, with the exception of South Lake Union. When taking public transit from South Lake Union, travel times took approximately 3 times longer than driving. This is likely due to South Lake Union location between major highway arteries I-99 and I-5, which lowers the travel time via driving to other locales. In addition, most public transit trips from South Lake Union require taking multiple bus trips, often first to downtown, then another bus towards the desired destination. There is also a great deal of construction in this area which could impede public transit access."

A map visualization of the peak vs. non-peak drive times is available here:\n",

    "The neighborhoods with the most traffic congestion delays during the morning commute were located in West Seattle and South Seattle. For neighborhoods in West Seattle, this is likely due to geographic and infrastructure constraints, as there is only one bridge to access central Seattle, where a significant portion of the destination neighborhoods are located. Also, there could be some bias in that the neighborhoods that had the worst traffic congestion also have to travel the most distance to other neighborhoods. Traffic delays can be exponential the longer you are driving, so the percent difference metric may not fully captured this. This could be addressed by controlling for distance in future studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this issue did not impact neighborhoods located in North Seattle, which had roughly average traffic congestion across all neighborhoods. This is likely because the I-5 express lanes are located in the southbound direction during the morning commute. It was very interesting to see this tradeoff between North and South Seattle. North Seattle has lower transit access, but benefits from express lanes during peak commuting hours. While South Seattle benefits from Link access, but has less accomodation in terms of express lanes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the neighborhoods with the least traffic congestion were located centrally in the downtown area. This makes sense, as there is less traffic when leaving downtown during the morning commute. Therefore, one shouldn't draw any significant conclusions from this finding."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Overall, the Distance Matrix API provided some interesting insights into the transit network. The challenges of connecting West Seattle are evident given the geographic constraints. The tradeoff between transit access and express lanes was interesting to see between North and South Seattle. However, there are significant limitations that should be discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Location Accuracy**\n",
    "\n",
    "The location accuracy of the Google Maps Distance Matrix API was very inconsistent. Some neighborhoods were excluded from my analysis (23rd and Jackson) because the API located it in Kansas City, despite the 'Seattle, WA' designation. Additionally, the Denny neighborhood was located as an actual 'Denny's' diner in Industrial District instead of the Denny neighborhood near downtown. These are only two of the issues I was able to diagnose, as checking the accuracy of results of the API is very difficult to do without time-consuming trial and error. If conducting this analysis again, I would enter the neighborhood locations as geocodes in order to ensure precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the actual location of each neighborhood is somewhat arbitrary. The Distance Matrix calculates travel times from a single location point. It is impossible to determine what the most representative point for a neighborhood as a whole is. For large neighborhoods, a single point may not be an appropriate means of assessing the access of the entire population.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neighborhood Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "The transit communities dataset was selected in the hopes of avoiding bias. However, bias is still prevalent in the neighborhoods included which greatly impact the results. For instance, many of the neighborhoods in South Seattle are located at Link stations. This likely overstated the access of these areas since public transit trips started from train stations. This was not the case for other neighborhoods included that also have Link stations, but were not located precisely at the train station.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the neighborhood sample may not have even representation from all regions. If more neighborhoods from North Seattle are included, then it greatly impacts the distance that other neighborhoods have to travel by comparison. It is difficult to assess the extent of this bias in this analysis, but I will acknowledge that it may exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Research**\n",
    "\n",
    "Future research could build on this study by correcting some of the location accuracy issues and reducing bias in the neighborhood selection. I would recommend using geocodes to determine exact neighborhood locations and develop a systematic way of identifying activity centers of interest that may be most most representative of the mobility around Seattle. Developing a representative sample of neighborhoods could be a challenge in itself. I was limited by the amount of destinations I could input into the API on the free tier. It would be interesting to see how results changed with a larger dataset. This could also help reduce bias in developing a representative sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "I only assessed neighborhoods in terms of trip origin. Trip destinations could also be assessed with this dataset. Additionally, users could enter their own API calls varying the time of day to see how that impacts mobility. I would expect to see very different results for traffic congestion during evening hours compared to the morning commute.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would also be interesting to see how this approach could be extrapolated to different cities. Some of the same issues with bias would arise, but this would be valuable in assessing whether the Google Maps Distance Matrix API can be used to assess mobility."

    "The answers to my initial research questions are summarized below.\n",
    "\n",
    "** 1\\. Can Google Maps Distance Matrix API be used to effectively assess mobility? **\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the Google Maps Distance Matrix API provided a decent overall picture of the Seattle transit network. There are issues with location accuracy, but the API provided flexible parameters that allows users to assess drive times, public transit times, and even biking times if they were so inclined. This could be useful tool for researchers in conducting their own analyses. It can give a good high level overview of mobility and is much cheaper and less analytically intensive than traffic demand models generated by transit officials.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2\\. Which neighborhoods in Seattle are underserved by the public transit network?**\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the results, South Lake Union stood out as a neighborhood that was underserved compared to its neighboring counterparts. Most neighborhoods located in North Seattle also appear to be underserved, but should benefit from Link access as soon as 2021. The neighborhood of Admiral in West Seattle had particularly bad transit access. \n",
    "\n",
    "** 3\\. Which neighborhoods in Seattle suffer from the worst traffic congestion on the morning commute?**\n",
    "\n",
    "During the morning commute hours, West Seattle and South Seattle suffered from the worst traffic congestion delays. For West Seattle, this is likely due to geographic constraints and limited access roads to the Central Seattle. Neighborhoods in North Seattle had lower traffic congestion delays than South Seattle, which is likely due to the express lanes on I-5 going southbound during the morning commute."
