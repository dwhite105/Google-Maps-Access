    "## Overview\n",
    "Transportation and mobility is a vital issue for all city residents, regardless of socioeconomic status. Transportation planners are faced with the difficult task of designing an equitable system that serves all citizens regardless of socioeconomic status. The reality is that not every system is perfect. Gaps in the transit network can develop due to various political and economic factors. These gaps can have a huge impact on home values, crime rate, and the quality of life for citizens living in different neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my project, I intend to investigate the makeup of the Seattle transportation network using the Google Maps Distance Matrix API. The Google Maps API provides the distance and travel time between two destinations by mode, time of day, etc. In order to assess public transit access, I will compare the driving times with public transit trip times for many origins and destinations around the Seattle metropolitian region. Areas in which public transit trip times are not significantly longer than drive time will be deemed accessible. Origin and destination pairings in which the travel time takes substantially longer via public transit will be deemed inaccessible. The results of the analysis will provide an interesting glimpse into the Seattle transportation network with an original dataset collected through API calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The research questions I intend to address will have a human-centered approach, as I am most interested in the ramifications of inequity of transit access across neighborhoods. Along with the initial quantitative findings, I will conduct additional research to see if the findings can be explained by particular neighborhood characteristics. The following sections cover potential research questions, project plan, and documentation on the data sources to be used.\n"

    "### Google Maps API\n",
    "\n",
    "The Google Maps API provides time and distance data between specified origins and destinations entered by the user. Users can also alter various parameters including mode of travel, time of day, etc. to customize their results. The documentation of the Google Maps Distance Matrix API is available here:\n",

With use of the API, users Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, license to use the Services in Customer Application(s), which may be: (a) fee-based or non-fee-based; (b) public/external or private/internal; (c) business-to-business or business-to-consumer; or (d) asset tracking.

    "This section outlines the general project plan in the steps that need to be completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the neighborhoods to be used in the analysis from the Transit Communities Dataset\n",
    "2. Set up parameters for calling the Google Maps Distance Matrix API. These include:\n",
    "    * origins and destinations\n",
    "    * travel mode (transit vs. driving)\n",
    "    * time of day\n",
    "3. Collect the data from the Google Maps API, saving the distance and travel time results between each neighborhood. The data for driving vs. transit and the time of day will be saved in separate files CSV files to avoid exceeding the max number of calls to the Google Maps API.\n",
    "4. Analyze the data investigating trends and key metrics. In particular, I plan on using the difference between driving and public transit times as an indicator of transit accessibility in a given area. This metric has some caveats, subject to localized circumstances, but is intended to provide basic insights to the mode choice that residents make every day.\n",
    "5. Create plots, tables, and visualizations to communicate the findings, answering the research questions listed in the section below."
